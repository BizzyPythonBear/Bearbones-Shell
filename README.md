## Requirements
These libraries are required for Bearbones to run:
- [sty](https://github.com/feluxe/sty)

## Config.json
Check the [config docs](https://github.com/BizzyPythonBear/Bearbones-Shell/blob/master/docs/config-files.md) on how to use the Config.json file.

## Built-in Shell commands
These are commands that are <b>built into</b> Bearbones.
```reset-bear```: Restarts shell
```todo```:       Shows my current to-do list
```info```:       Shows some extra info

Bearbones currently work with almost every single command that comes with linux. The only commands that don't work are ```vim```, ```neofetch```, and some others. I have not yet tested all of them yet.

## Configuring your Bearbones shell
Configuring Bearbones shell is pretty simple, though the names of the settings may be confusing.

### Different settings
Currently, as of 3.2.2a, there are 4 settings that you can change.
These include:
- ```useCustomCommands```:        This can be set to true or false to choose whether or not you want to have custom commands enabled.
- ```customCommandDirectory```:   If ```useCustomCommands``` is set to "true", you need to put the directory that leads to the binaries here.
- ```textColor```:                Allows you to change the colors of the brackets, colon, and dash, excluding the directory inside of the brackets.
- ```dirColor```:                 Allows you to change the colors of the directory held inside of the brackets, excluding anything else.

### Colors
There are a wide range of colors to choose from when it comes to styling your terminal.
